# BehavioirelStatesPIMD
People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) would benefit greatly from intelligent systems in their vicinity. They are unable to use them due to relative high complexity of these systems. The main problem is their lack of producing or understanding of symbolic communication. The goal of our work is to provide an intelligent framework that enables them to communicate their wishes and feelings to the outside world.


At this time only the papers published are collected here. Once the project is redy the source code will be published here.
